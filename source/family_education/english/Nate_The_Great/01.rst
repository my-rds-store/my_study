Nate The Great
==============================================


My name is Nate the great. 

I am a **detective** [#f1]_ .

I work alone.

Let me tell you about my last **case** [#f2]_ :

I had just eaten breakfast.

It was a good breakfast.

Pancakes , **juice** [#f3]_ , Pancakes, milk, and Pancakes.

I like Pancakes.

The telephone rang.

I hoped it was a call to look for lost **diamonds** [#f4]_ or **pearls** [#f5]_ or a million dollars.

It was Annie.

Annie lives down the street.

I knew that Annie did not diamonds or pearls or a million dollars to lose. 

"I lose a picture", she said.

"Can you help me find it ?"

"Of course", I said.


"I have found lost ballons, books, slippers, chickens. Even
a lost goldfish. Now I, Nate The Great, will find a lost picture."

"Oh , good " Annie said.

"When can you come over ?"

"I will be over in five minutes," I said.

"Stay right  where you are.
Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE!" 


"My foot itches," Annie said.

"Scratch it", I said.

I put on my detective suit.

I took my notebook and pencil.

I left a note for my mother.

I always leave a note for my mother when I am on a case. 

I went to Annie's house.

Annie has brown hair and brown eyes.

And she smiles a lot.

I would like Annie if I liked girls.

She was eating breakfast Pancakes.

"I like pancakes," I said.

It was a good breakfast.

"Tell me about your picture," I said.

"I painted a picture of my dog, Fang," Annie said.

"I put it on my desk to dry. Then it was gone. It happend yesterday."

"You should have called me yesterday," I said, "while the trail was hot.
I hate cool trails. Now, where would a picture go ?"

"I don't know," Annie said.

"That's why I called you"

"Ary you sure, you're a detective ?"

"Sure, I'm sure. I will find the picture of Fang", I said.

"Tell me. Does this house have any trapdoors or 
secret passages ?"

"No," Annie said.

"No trapdors or secret passages?"

I said, "This will be a very dull case."

"I have a door that squeaks," Annie said.

"Have it fixed," I said.

"Now show me you room"

We went to Annie's room.

I was big. It had yellow walls, a yellow bed, a yellow chair, 
and a yellow desk.

I, Nate the Great, was sure one thing. Annie liked yellow.
