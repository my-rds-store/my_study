remenber you nead repetition and nonvelty , 
after a while if you're listening to same thing over and over again, 
the brain is picking up less and less and less.

Hi there Steve Kaufman here ,today I want to talk about listening skills. 
listening skils how to get better at listening . 
how to use listening to learn a language.

remenber if you enjoy these videos please subscribe . 
click on the bell for notifications. 

So as you know i consider input listening and reading to be keys learning a language . 

you have to get the language into you . it has to come from outside. 
you have to get your brain used to a new language.

this is a best achieved through listening and reading . 

reading helps you acquire more words,  
but listening gets your brain used to the language , 

and ofcourse listening **comprehension** [#f1]_  is a **tremendously** [#f2]_ important skill. 

because if you're speaking to some one and we all want to speak in the language , 
if you can't understand what they're saying , what the other person is saying , 
then it's very uncomfortable and you can't have a very meaningful conversation. 

so how do you use listening to get better in the language , 
and what are the trips to get better at listening , 

first of all, it depends on each person , 
but i can't sit down and just listen.  

if i ware to sit and i've tried it . 
so i have whatever lesson i'm listening to and i sit down comfortabel chair , 
and i say I'm going to spend half an hour listening to this podcast(播客) or whatever is might be,  
I'm **incapable** [#f3]_ of doing that, 
my mind **wanders** [#f4]_ , so i can't **concentrate** [#f5]_ . 

if i have **dedicated** [#f6]_ study time then I'm going to read 
or I'm going to work on my ipad with LingQ. 

so where dose the listening come in . 
listening has the **tremendous** [#f7]_ **advantage**  [#f8]_ , that we can do it wherever we are. 

I don't have my Air pods handy , 
but i have my Airpods , 
and i recently bought a new kind of Airpod. 
that sits outsid the ear , and they work really well. 
I went **jogging**  [#f9]_ yesterday , and i could hear very vell. 
and i don't have these things actually plugged into my ear. 

but I can listen first thing in the morning . 
I get up i have little seven minute **exercise**  [#f10]_ **routine** [#f11]_ i listen. 

i make breakfast i listen , 
if i exercise **during the day** i listening , 
if i'm in the car i listen. 
so you've got all this time to listen , all right. 

so then people say well, when you are listening do you always focus ? 

all right, it is impossible to 100 focus while listening . 

you have to like so mach in language learning. 

you have to accept **imperfection** . 

so when speak you're going to make mistakes.  

when you listen there's going to be lots of areas you don't understand ,

there are also going to be **moments** 
when you are not focused on what you're listening to . 

you lose track ,you your mind **wanders** off somewhere else . 

that's fine , as long as you come back , 
and so let's say for a **period** of 30 minutes , 
that i'm in the car listening to something. 

maybe i'm only focused on what i'm listening to for half that time 
or i don't know what the number is, 
because i don't worry about is .
but i know it's not a hundred percent of the time.

but for whatever **percentage** of the time.
I'm listening i'm **exposing** my brain to the language
and I'am getting used to the launguage.

now one of the thing that's very important is 
you cannot continue to listen to your target language.
and not understand anyting or only uanderstand five percent.

that is very **inefficient** in my **experience**.
so if I listen to something 
**obviously** at the **early stages** in the language,
i don't understand anything. 

but then i will read it .
i will look up the words . 
i'll review them in LingQ.
read it again then i'll listen.

and i still don't understand.
even though i understood kind of when i was reading and looking up words, when i go to listen I don't understand.
but that doesn't **bother** me 

I konw that from personal **experience** that in time.
what **initially** is just noise for me ,
by a process of reading and listening,
and going back and reading again.
and looking up words again and listening again,
eventually more and more of this becomes **comprehensible**.

don't listen to the same lesson over and over and over again at one sitting.
in other words, the brain as i've said many times requies repetition and novelty.

so you can listen to an item a few times.
and then move to the next item ,
even if you don't fully understand the first .

so you have lesson one and you listen and you listen,
and you read it then you listen agian, 
and you understand twenty thirty percent, move on to the next one.

don't try to you know master. 
and **particular** lesson or **content** item.
it's all **exposure**, it's all helping the brain get used to the language.

remember you nead repetition and novelty, after a while
if you're listening to the same thing over and over again.
the brain is picking up less and less and less.

so you have to move to the next lesson, and to next lesson
so keep pushing yourself forward ,  `maintain`_  that **balance** between repetition and novelty.


and there's all kinds of research **into** how the brian learns that sort of block learning, 
that third fourth fifth time we read something or we listen to something.
.(有一些涉及大脑学习的影响因素的研究表明当我们重复听或读某些内容到了第三遍四遍五遍) 
we are in fact learning less and less.
so you have to keep moving forward.

now so don't worry about losing focus.
don't worry about what you don't understand.
keep challenging or rewarding you brain with new **material** .

but do have enough repetition.
so that you start to notice certain  things that you didn't notice the first time.

and this is the next point about listening.

I can listen to a mimi story .

that i've listened to 30 40 times before.

so i know the mini stoy.

and yet will **suddenly** notice a structure.

a verb pattern, verb from that i hadn't really noticed before, 
even though i knew the rule **vaguely** , but the 31st time that i listened to that , 
I notice it in different way .

so give yourself a **chance** to notice thing .
when you go back for that **additional** pass through the same material.

so you're again  you're **maintaining** that repetition and novelty.

but when you're on your in your repetition activity.
allow yourself to notice **certain** things.
you don't have to notice everything, you can lose focus.

but there will be times when you notice **certain** things in there.
that will help you in your **gradual acquisition** of the language .

and remember that listening **comprehension** here is the goal.
it's not going to be perfect , but it will **gradually** **improve**.
and the better your listening **comprehension** , the better your **ability** to have conversasions. 

but again give yourself, you konw a **variety** between repetion. 
repetious **material** and new challenging material .
**combine** reading with listening.

try to focus in on certain **aspects** of **pronunciation** that you maybe didn't notice before . (尝试关注那些你之前听，没有注意到的方面) 

be **aware** that some of the things 
that you didn't notice on the fisrt time listening or the secend or the fifth or the tenth time.
you may notice the 20th time you listen.

so the process of **acquisition** of a language is **gradual** .
so if you listen and you don't understand don't get **frustrated**

if you listen and read and listen and read, and still don't understand don't get **frustrated** . 
that's normal. 
and **at least** **in my own case** , 
i **prefer** to be listening and doing someting else 
cleaning up the **garage** whatever it might be 
listening **fading out** focusing in again . 

that works better for me than trying to sit down ,
and say okay for the next half hour i'm to listen to this all right.

the **exception** of that of course , 
is if you're watching a movie which is a form of listing ,
but you're watching and listening at the same time.

and it's rewarding because it's fun to watch movie.
and you can see the people , you can almost feel as if you're **participating** with this familay.
that's why series you know on netflix are so great.
if it's the same group of people.
**interacting** all the time in the series.

and you watch them and you feel you're part of them 
and you're getting that sense of being in that cultural.
you konw uh sphere um all of that is good.
but i wouldn't you konw .
I consider the sort of video movies tv series.

that's more of a reward that's fun.
you have to develop the ability.
to be able to listen without seeing what's going on.

uh initially sort of repetitious material like the mini stories.
eventually audiobooks where just hearing the words,
conjures up meaning for you .

so that you're automatically conversation you konw words in the target language into meaning .
and so as you build up to that level of of listening comprehension.
you are preparing youself to become fluent in the language.

so that's my advice treat listening.
and listening comprehension.
not only as a primary goal in language learing. 
but as an important way of helping you brain.
become accustomed to the language.
so I hope that was helpfull,  
thank you for listening .
