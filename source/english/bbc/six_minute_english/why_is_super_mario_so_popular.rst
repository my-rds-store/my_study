Rob
    Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Rob.

Georgina
    And I’m Georgina.

Rob
    Now, Georgina, you recently mentioned [#f1]_ in one 6 Minute English programme about NFTs 
    and that you had a collection [#f2]_ of Pokemon cards when you were younger. 

Georgina
    Yes – I did, and I still can’t find them. Why did you **bring that up**? 

Rob
    Well, Pokemon **started out** [#f3]_ as a video game series that turned into anime [#f4]_ movies 
    and trading [#f5]_ cards among other things 
    – and in this programme we’re talking about a video game character [#f6]_ that is **iconic** [#f7]_ 
    – a word which means widely [#f8]_ known and recognised [#f9]_ . 
    That character’s name is Super Mario.

Georgina
    Ahhh I spent many hours of my childhood playing with Nintendo’s Super Mario 
    or his rival [#f10]_, Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog [#f11]_ .

Rob
    Now, these days, video games are everywhere, and people of all ages enjoy playing them. 
    There’s also competitive [#f12]_ e-sports events where gamers compete [#f13]_  for what are often [#f14]_ considerable [#f15]_ amounts [#f16]_ of money.

Georgina
    Yes, and there are also streamers that appear [#f17]_ on  platforms like Twitch and YouTube who have become celebrities [#f18]_ **in their own right** [#f19]_ .

Rob
    Talking about celebrities [#f18]_ , I have a question about the famous [#f20]_ character we’re talking about in this programme.
    Many people remember Super Mario Bros [#f21]_ . as being the first time we saw Mario, but he first appeared [#f17]_ in another game – which was it? Was it:
    ::

            a) The Legend of Zelda - 《塞尔达传说》
            b) Donkey Kong; or    - 《大金刚》
            c) Pokemon -《宠物小精灵》


Georgina
    I’m not sure about that – I can’t remember him being in Pokemon, so I’ll go for a) The Legend of Zelda. 

Rob
    OK, Georgina, we’ll **find out** if you’re right at the end of the programme. 
    So, we established [#f22]_ at the start of the programme that these days the video games industry [#f23]_ is thriving [#f24]_ .

Georgina
    True – but it wasn’t always that way. It’s hard to imagine [#f25]_ now, 
    but in the 1980s the **console market** [#f26]_ was struggling [#f27]_ , particularly [#f28]_ in the US.

Rob
    Keza MacDonalds, video games editor for the **Guardian newspaper** [#f29]_ , explains [#f30] what was happening in the early 1980s (20世纪80年代初期). 
    Here she is on BBC World Service programme You and Yours, speaking with Peter White(彼得·怀特).

Keza MacDonald
    Well, back then, especially in America, there had been **a flood of** [#f31]_ games that were just not very high quality. 
    One of the games that’s often [#f14]_ cited [#f32]_ as a factor [#f33]_ in the collapse [#f34]_ was this game called ET on the Atari, 
    which was so bad they **ended up** [#f35]_ burying [#f36]_ thousands of copies of it in the desert [#f37]_ , because nobody liked it.

    And, so we’d had that, especially in America, this didn't happen so much in Europe, 
    but in America just been lots and lots of software.  None of it was all that great. 
    There hadn't been anything really revolutionary [#f38]_ in some years, 
    so the video game boom [#f39] was really **falling off a cliff ** [#f40] and Nintendo **is what rescued** [#f41]_ in the US especially.

Georgina
    Keza MacDonald used the term **a flood of**  – meaning a large number in a short period of time 
    – to describe the number of games that were coming out.

Rob
    She used cited [#f32]_, which means referenced or noted, 
    when talking about the game ET being a reference for a factor [#f33]_ in the collapse [#f34]_  of the **console market** [#f26]_ .

Georgina
    And she said boom – a sudden period of growth. 
    So as ET was mentioned [#f1]_ as a factor [#f33]_ in the collapse [#f34]_ , many people say that Super Mario Bros [#f21]_ . 
    was the reason that video games really **took off** [#f42]_ , especially in the US.

Rob
    It’s interesting [#f43]_ to consider what might have been if his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto(宫本茂）, had never created that character [#f6]_ . 
    The question is, why is that game so popular, what made it so fun to play?

Georgina
    Here is Keza Macdonald speaking again with Peter White, on BBC World Service programme, You and Yours, explaining why Mario is just so popular and what makes the original game so satisfying to play.

Keza MacDonald
    It’s just such a joy to play. It's running and jumping, and it's the joy of movement. When, when you play, even the original Super Mario Bros [#f21]_ , you just feel this sense of joy in your movement, and it's one of the greatest games ever made. And a lot of games from 35 years ago are basically unplayable now. They might have been a step to something greater, but Mario was one of those few that really holds up today as it did then.

Rob
    Keza Macdonald said that some games from 35 years ago are unplayable – so, not possible to play them.

Georgina
    But she said that Mario holds up – a term used to say that something’s standards or quality has not lessened.

Rob
    It certainly does hold up – in fact, I played it the other day and I had lots of fun with it – it reminded me of my childhood, and it’s still as good now as it was then.

Georgina
    Which reminds me of your quiz question, Rob.

Rob
    Yes, in my quiz question I asked Georgina which game had the first appearance of that famous [#f20]_ plumber, Mario.

Georgina
    I went for a) The Legend of Zelda.

Rob
    Which is wrong, I’m afraid! Mario’s first appearance was in Donkey Kong, and his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, never thought he would be that popular.

Georgina
    Well, I guess we’ve all really learnt something today. Let’s recap the vocabulary from today’s programme about Super Mario, starting with iconic [#f7]_ 
    – famously associated with something and instantly recognisable . 

Rob
    Then we had a flood of which means a large amount of something in a short space of time.

Georgina
    Cited means reference as or noted.

Rob
    Boom relates to explosion and means a short period of sudden growth. 

Georgina
    Unplayable describes something that can’t be played or a game that is very difficult to enjoy.

Rob
    And finally, holds up means that the quality or standards of something hasn’t changed and still looks good or plays well.

Georgina
    That’s all for this programme.

Rob
    Bye for now!

Georgina
    Bye!
