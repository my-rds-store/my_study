Neil
    Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.

Sam
    And I’m Sam.

Neil
    What do shopping with a credit [#f1]_ card, finding love through internet dating [#f2]_ 
    and waiting for the traffic lights to change have in common?

Sam
    Hmmm, they all involve [#f3]_ computers? 

Neil
    Good guess, Sam! But how exactly [#f4]_ do those computers work? 
    The answer is that they all use algorithms [#f5]_ 
    – sets [#f6]_ of mathematical [#f7]_ instructions [#f8]_ which find solutions to problems.

Sam
    Although they are often hidden, algorithms are all around us. 
    From mobile phone maps to home delivery [#f9]_ pizza [#f10]_, they play a big part of modern [#f11] life. 
    And they’re the topic of this programme.

Neil
    A simple way to think of algorithms is as recipes [#f12]_ . 
    To make pancakes [#f13]_ you mix flour [#f14]_ , eggs and milk, 
    then melt [#f15]_ butter [#f16]_ in a **frying pan** [#f17]_ **and so on** [#f18]_ . 
    Computers do this in more a complicated [#f19]_ way by repeating mathematical equations [#f20]_ over and over again.

Sam
    Equations [#f20]_ are mathematical sentences [#f21]_ showing how two things are equal. 
    They’re similar [#f22]_ to algorithms and the most famous scientific [#f23]_ equation of all, 
    Einstein's E=MC :sup:`2` , can be thought of as a three-part algorithm.

Neil
    But before my brain gets squashed by all this maths, I have a quiz question for you, Sam. As you know, Einstein’s famous equation is E=MC :sup:`2` - but what does the ‘E’ stand for? Is it:
    ::

        a)    electricity?
        b)    energy?  or
        c)    everything?


Sam
    I’m tempted to say ‘E’ is for ‘everything’ but I reckon I know the answer: b – ‘E’ stands for ‘energy’.

Neil
    OK, Sam, we’ll find out if you’re right later in the programme.

Sam
    With all this talk of computers, you might think algorithms are a new idea. In fact, they’ve been around since Babylonian times, around 4,000 years ago.

Neil
    And their use today **can be** **controversial** . Some algorithms used in internet search engines have been accused of racial prejudice.

Sam
    Ramesh Srinivasan is Professor of Information Studies at the University of California. Here’s what he said when asked what the word ‘algorithm’ actually means by BBC World Service’s programme, The Forum: 

Ramesh Srinivasan
    My understanding of the term ‘algorithm’ is that it’s not necessarily the bogyman, or its not necessarily something that is, you know, inscrutable or mysterious to all people 
    – it’s the set of instructions [#f8]_  that you write in some mathematical form or in some software code 
    – so it’s the repeated set of instructions [#f8]_ that are sequenced, that are used and applied to answer a question or resolve a problem 
    – it’s a simple as that, actually.

Sam
    Some think that algorithms have been controversial, but Professor Srinivasan says they are not necessarily the bogyman. The bogyman refers to something people call ‘bad’ or ‘evil’ to make other people afraid.

Neil
    Professor Srinivasan thinks algorithms are neither evil nor inscrutable – not showing emotions or thoughts and therefore very difficult to understand. 

Sam
    Still, it can be difficult to understand exactly what algorithms are, especially when there are many different types of them. So, let’s take an example. 

Neil
    It’s autumn and we want to collect all the apples from our orchard and divide them into three groups – big, medium and small. One method is to collect all the apples together and compare their sizes.

Sam
    But doing this would take hours! It’s much easier to first collect the apples from only one tree - divide those into big, medium or small – and then repeat the process for the other trees, one by one. 

Neil
    That’s basically what algorithms do – they find the most efficient way to get things done, or in other words, get the best results in the quickest time. 

Sam
    Mathematics professor Ian Stewart agrees. Listen as he explains how the algorithm called ‘bubble sort’ works to BBC World Service’s programme, The Forum:

Ian Stewart
    Think of when your computer is sorting emails by date and maybe you’ve got 500 emails and it sorts them by date in a flash. Now it doesn’t use bubble sort, but it does use a sorting method and if you tried to do that by hand it would take you a very long time, whatever method you used.  

Neil
    Professor Stewart describes how algorithms sort emails. To sort is a verb meaning to group together things which share similarities.

Sam
    Just like grouping the apples by size, sorting hundreds of emails by hand would take a long time. But using algorithms, computers do it in a flash – very quickly or suddenly.

Neil
    That phrase – in a flash – reminds me of how Albert Einstein came up with his famous equation, E=MC :sup:`2`.

Sam
    And that reminds me of your quiz question. You asked about the ‘E’ in E=MC :sup:`2`. I said it stands for ‘energy’. So, was I right?

Neil
    ‘Energy’ is the correct answer. Energy equals ‘M’ for mass, multiplied by the Constant  ‘C’ which is the speed of light, squared.

Sam
    OK, let’s recap the vocabulary from this programme, starting with equation – a mathematical statement using symbols to show two equal things.

Neil
    If something is called a bogyman, it’s something considered bad and to be feared.

Sam
    Inscrutable people don’t show their emotions so are very difficult to get to know.

Neil
    Efficient means working quickly and effectively in an organised way 

Sam
    The verb to sort means to group together things which share similarities. 

Neil
    And finally, if something happens in a flash, it happens quickly or suddenly.

Sam
    That’s all the time we have to discuss algorithms. And if you’re still not 100% sure about exactly what they are, we hope at least you’ve learned some useful vocabulary!

Neil
    Join us again soon for more trending topics, sensational science and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. Bye for now!

Sam
    Goodbye!
